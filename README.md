# TicketSystem
Whats up everyone? 
I created this program for two reasons.

  1. I am learning Python.
  2. I needed something to help me at work stay organized with tasks I need to do.

I started this program while learning classes and wrote it mostly by what I have learned. 
The first version was basic, and was command line only, but it worked.
This is why the current version is called Tickets4.
But then I decided to dabble a bit with some GUI to make it easier to use.
I used AI to help with this, and then decided to keep learning with AI.

I started with a bit of knowledge, and I used technology to learn even more.

Anyways, the program itself is pretty basic. Its a "to do" system at best.
I call the tasks or jobs, "tickets".

When you have something new to do, create a ticket.
When you have worked on the ticket, or maybe you need to add a note a while later, you can update the ticket.
When you have a task thats not done, but theres nothing more you can do at this time, you can move the ticket to pending.
When the job is done, you can simply close the ticket.
You can edit the original tickets as well if needed.

I've put a lot of care into the design of the program. I wanted to make it efficent, but keep it simple.
